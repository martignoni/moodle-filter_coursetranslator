# Translatable for Moodle

Translatable is a derivation of [Content Translation Manager](https://moodle.org/plugins/tool_translationmanager) and [Fulltranslate](https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_fulltranslate) merged into a single plugin. It provides a content translation page for courses and automatic machine translation using the DeepL Pro Translation api.

## Installation

Clone or download this plugin to ```/moodlewww/filter/translatable``` and run through the Database upgrade process. This plugin adds a ```filter_translatable``` table to your database to store and query translated strings in your courses.
